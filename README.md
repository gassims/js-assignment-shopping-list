# js-assignment-shopping-list

This is an assignment in a Javascript course (Web Developer in 2023 with HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node.js, Machine Learning & more!). The point of this assignment is to use events to modify the DOM (HTML and CSS). We are asked to 'fix' previous and new entries to have a delete button beside each entry as well as for each entry be crossedthrough when clicked.
